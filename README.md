# Quick Sticky Note
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)
A very simple sticky notes application stripped down to the bare minimum.

I made this because my needs are very simple:
Open a note on the desktop → type in → delete when done.
No fancy customization.
No unnecessary features.
Super simple, super easy setup.

## How it works
Right-click the desktop and use the context menu option for the .qnote file type:

This will:
* Create a .qnote file in your %LOCALAPPDATA%\QuickSticky\ folder.

* Open a sticky note window at your current cursor position.

## Closing a note
The note stays open until you click the X three times.
This safety measure avoids accidental closures.

When closed, the program will:
* Delete the associated .qnote file.
* Terminate the note process if it's the last note open.

## Startup behavior
The installer sets the app to run on system startup.
On startup, it will:
* Look for existing .qnote files and reopen them.
* If none are found, the app immediately exits — nothing runs in the background unless you have a note on screen.

## Purpose
The goal is to have a quick, visible reminder for simple tasks — not to use the desktop as a calendar replacement.
